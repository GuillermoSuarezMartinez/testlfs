04.21.2008 - Fixed RaiseEventSafe in Winsock.vb and WinsockCollection.vb to use BeginInvoke instead of Invoked.  Changed order of operations in ReceiveCallbackUDP to allow remote IP address to be detected properly.

03.25.2008 - Added a NetworkStream property to expose a NetworkStream object that uses the connection made by this component.

03.24.2008 - Fixed Listen methods to properly raise state changed events for UDP as well as TCP.  Modified IWinsock, WinsockBase, and AsyncSocket to allow AsyncSocket to modify the LocalPort property of the component.

02.14.2008 - Fixed a bug in UDP receiving that caused it to always receive at the full byte buffer instead of size of the incoming data.

12.26.2007 - Added new event ReceiveProgress.

12.13.2007 - Fixed PacketHeader.AddHeader to use .Length instead of .GetUpperBound(0).  Also changed AsyncSocket.ProcessIncoming in two places with the same change (second half of the first nested IF statements with the >= comparison operator).

11.19.2007 - Completed WinsockDesigner to original intentions.  Can now jump to event code using the Action list.

11.14.2007 - Demo programs completed, and test ran successfully (quick tests)
